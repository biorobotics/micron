Hi Nico,

Unfortunately we don’t have a newer version of our Linux library available.
Is there a specific linker error I can try to help debug?

Regards,
Ian

Hi Ian. My name is Nico and I work at CMU. We emailed a long time ago about getting the claron micron tracker sdk to compile. Unfortunately with a switch to a new computer I am getting a new set of linking errors. In particular concerning libMTC.a not being compiled with -fPIC. Additionally it is compiled against vxl which has changed quite a bit since v1.17 (which in turn no longer compiles with modern gcc)

Just wondering if it was ever updated or of there is a new version of libMTC

Thanks,

Nico

Hi Nico,

Glad to hear things are running somewhat better now. Sorry about any mix-up with the calibration file name.
I was thinking that the nVidia driver issue would be related to the FLTK GUI code, but it looks like the JHU code is using QT.
I haven’t seen any negative interactions before between graphics cards and the camera.
You mentioned switching to an old FireWire card, does it have extra power connector available? Or only through the PCI slot?

Is there any way to test the JHU code without a camera connected. I am wondering if it is only freezing up when trying to use the camera.

Regards,
Ian

Hi, So we made some progress. It looks like the file you sent over was missing a capital B and the examples couldn't find it. Once we fixed that, both examples ran. The simpleC example ran flawlessly but we are having trouble with the CPP demo, as that hangs after only a couple of frames. The GUI is unresponsive and we don't see any new frames. Interestingly this is also the case with the code that the JHU folks wrote that you can find here https://github.com/jhu-saw/sawClaronMicronTracker/tree/devel.

We had a suspicion that it had something to do with graphics drivers so we switched from nvidia to Nouveau and this indeed fixed the issue on the CPP demo, but not on our program. Have you had any experience with this? Are nvidia drivers a known issue?

Thanks,

Nico

Hi Nico,

Good to confirm that the camera is functional and streaming images.
We do not actually use FlyCapture on Linux, but rather use libdc1394 for the FireWire communication.

You might try installing a newer version of the libdc1394 library.
You would need to remove the link the static libdc1394.a provided, and link to the new library with '-ldc1394’ compiler flag.

Ian

A few updates:

First we couldn't see the firewire device created under Linux.   We used an older FireWire adapter known to work on our computer along with a firewire A to A (6pins) and that solved the problem, i.e. we can see /dev/fw0 AND /dev/fw1.   Then we added the user id to group "video" to get the unix permissions fixed.    With this done, FlyCap 2.10 still failed to enumerate the camera.  We found the following info on PointGrey:
https://www.ptgrey.com/KB/11106

Downloading the FlyCap 2.13 SDK was a bit tricky, we found that if you set your product to Dragon2, PointGrey's site shows the link for 2.13  for Ubuntu 16.04 64bits.   Once we installed FlyCap 2.13, we were able to see live images!

At that point, we can't get any MTC based code to enumerate the camera so we wonder if it's because libMTC.a is linked against and older FlyCapture SDK.   Would you be able recompile/relink libMTC against FlyCap 2.13?

I've cc'ed one of our collaborators at JHU that we are collaborating with who is also using this system.

Thanks,

Nico

If you are getting mtDataNotAvailable, then it is might be some issue detecting the FireWire camera on the bus.

You can try to download the FlyCapture SDK (camera manufacturer software) to check whether it is something in the MicronTracker code or a general camera problem:

Could it be the permissions for the firewire card?

I printed out  the result of Cameras_AttachAvailableCameras using
    result = Cameras_AttachAvailableCameras( calibrationDir);
    printf("Result: %i", result);
and get
Result: 13 No camera available or missing calibration file. Please also check that MTHome system environment variable is set

I believe 13 is mtDataNotAvailable?

OK, if I leave the firewire unplugged from the computer while I restart, then plug it in, I get a steady green light.

I mistyped earlier.
It turns out netbeans ignores my .bashrc even though its terminal does not. I had to add the environment in the project settings under 'run'
See the attached screenshot

The code for SimpleDemoC is back to reading

    char *localNamePtr = getenv("MTHome");
    if ( localNamePtr) {

It might be because of the blinking, that is usually some sort of driver issue.
Sometimes powering down the machine and doing a cold boot with the camera plugged in can help.

It might still be a calibration file issue.

In your code:
    if ( localNamePtr) {
        strncpy(sMTHome, localNamePtr, size-1);
        sMTHome[size] = '\0';
    } else {

You listed biomed user, but your environment variable says biorobotics?

Maybe you print out the value of ‘calibrationDir’ to see where it is looking for calibrations files.

I've tried unplugging and replugging in multiple times. Yesterday it was glowing green. I've also tried restarting the computer.

You are right, when I switched to debugging mode I hadn't set the flag for it. Now it is indeed compiling and running.

I have
export MTHome='/home/biorobotics/MicronTracker/'

You should use the calibration file I attached yesterday as is, without renaming.
You’ll need to place it in ‘$MTHome/CalibrationFiles’ directory, or ‘/home/biomed/MicronTracker/CalibrationFiles’

The stack overflow may be a pointer size mismatch.
Can you tell whether the files were compiled with LINUX64 flag? It should appear somewhere in compiler options as ‘-DLINUX64’

The camera should glow a dull green when plugged in but not capturing, and then when capturing it will glow brighter. If it is blinking, you can just try to unplug it and reattach.
Maybe there is a stack overflow in the SimpleDemo too, so the capture didn’t start correctly.

Any additional outputs after loading the calibration file?

Do I have to tell it the name of the calibration file? Should I rename the calibration file to match the one that came with my camera?
